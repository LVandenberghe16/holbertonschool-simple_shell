# SIMPLE SHELL MANUAL

## NAME
**hsh** \- Simple Unix shell implementation.

## SYNOPSIS
```bash
hsh
```

## DESCRIPTION
**hsh** is a simple implementation of a Unix command-line interpreter. This program provides basic shell functionality, including the execution of commands, support for PATH resolution, and built-in commands such as `exit` and `env`.

## USAGE
### Interactive Mode
Launch the shell and enter commands manually. The shell displays a prompt, and you can type commands to execute.
```bash
$ ./hsh
($) ls
file1  file2
($) exit
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
Pass commands to the shell via a pipe or a file. The shell executes the commands and exits.
```bash
echo "ls" | ./hsh
cat commands.txt | ./hsh
```

## BUILT-IN COMMANDS
### `exit`
Exits the shell.
- Usage: `exit [status]`
- If `status` is provided, it will be the exit status of the shell.

### `env`
Prints the current environment variables.
- Usage: `env`

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
### Files
1. `main.c`:
   - Entry point of the shell.
   - Determines interactive or non-interactive mode.

2. `shell.c`:
   - Handles both interactive and non-interactive shell behaviors.

3. `builtins.c`:
   - Implements built-in commands such as `exit` and `env`.

4. `execute.c`:
   - Executes commands using `execve`.

5. `path.c`:
   - Resolves the full path of commands using the `PATH` environment variable.

6. `utils.c`:
   - Helper functions for string handling, memory management, etc.

### Compilation
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

### Example
```bash
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
file1  file2
($) env
USER=ludwig
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
($) exit 0
```

### Error Handling
- Outputs errors in the format:
```bash
./hsh: <line_number>: <command>: <error_message>
```
- Example:
```bash
($) nonexistent_command
./hsh: 1: nonexistent_command: not found
```

### Memory Management
- The shell ensures no memory leaks through proper allocation and deallocation.
- Verified using tools like `valgrind`.
